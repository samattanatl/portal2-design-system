# Sidebar Navigation (pattern)

The primary desktop navigation rail for the E-Approval app — workspace switcher, search, and a grouped, collapsible list of request-type shortcuts.

Figma: [`📱 Navigation`](https://www.figma.com/design/YFci6zgeYAQqX2OlHKQB0e) page, `Sidebar Navigation` component set. Tokens referenced below are defined in [`../../DESIGN.md`](../../DESIGN.md).

## Why this is a "pattern" doc, not a "component" doc

Unlike [Avatar](../components/avatar.md) or [Button](../components/button.md), this isn't a single atom with a token-by-token anatomy table — it's an assembly of ~117 nested instances built from smaller pieces. A pattern doc describes **what it's built from, how those pieces are arranged, and what states the whole thing has** — not individual token bindings (those belong to whichever doc owns each underlying atom).

## Composition

Reuses components already documented elsewhere in the system:
- `IconButton/Icon Button` (Ghost style) — search shortcut trigger, row-level actions
- `Notification / Counter`, `icon_container`/icon-library instances — remote (external library), out of scope to rebind, see [Table](../components/table.md)'s precedent
- Icon-library instances (remote) for every item icon

Built from Navigation-specific atoms, now fully audited and documented on their own:
- [Workspace menu](../components/nav-workspace-menu.md) — the logo + workspace name row at top
- [Shortcut container](../components/nav-shortcut-container.md) — the "⌘K" search shortcut hint
- [Section Label](../components/nav-section-label.md) — the small caps group headers ("Favorites", "Expense & Payment", etc.)
- [Navigation item L1](../components/nav-item-l1.md) — a top-level row (icon + label + optional trailing badge/count)
- [Navigation Item L2 & L2 Breadcrumb](../components/nav-item-l2.md) — nested sub-items shown under an L1 item (e.g. "All request" under "Requests")
- [Unfoldable Navigation Item list](../components/nav-unfoldable-list.md) — the collapsible group wrapper combining an L1 parent with its L2 children

## Layout rules

- **`Type` = `Regular` (228px, expanded) / `Small` (40px, icon-only collapsed rail).** Small hides all labels/section headers and shows only the icon column — same items, same order, no separate content model.
- **Top-to-bottom structure:** Workspace switcher → Search → `Favorites` section (pinned shortcuts, no collapse) → one or more request-type sections, each with a `Section Label` and either a flat list of L1 items or an `Unfoldable Navigation Item list` wrapping L1+L2 items.
- **Root container:** `spacing/8` (32px) gap between major sections, `spacing/2`/`spacing/4` (8px/16px) outer padding.
- **"Soon" tag:** a pill-shaped chip (`border-radii/rounded-infinite`) marking not-yet-available nav items, `spacing/2` (8px) padding.

## States

- **Navigation item:** `Default` / `Selected` — selected shows a filled background + colored icon/label (seen on "All request" in the screenshot).
- **Unfoldable group:** `Collapsed` / `Extended`.
- **Workspace menu:** `Default` / `Hover` / `Loading`, `Type=App` / `Type=Settings`.

## Known gaps (component doesn't yet match spec, or naming is inconsistent)

- **Per-item icon accent color** (Peach/Sky/Ocean/Stone seen in the real usage screenshot) doesn't have a documented assignment rule — unclear if it's a deliberate categorization system (e.g. per request-type) or unstandardized per-item styling. Needs a decision from the design owner, not a guess.
- **`Shortcut contaienr`** is a real Figma component name with a typo — flagged in its own doc, not renamed without confirmation.
- A handful of deeper sub-atoms referenced by [Navigation item L1](../components/nav-item-l1.md) (`Sidebar icons`, `Badge`, `Badge noti`) weren't independently audited or documented in this pass — they were in scope only where a trivial fix was obvious (e.g. an unbound border-width). A full audit of those would be a further, separate pass.
- A few remaining foreign-token references trace into **remote (external library) icon instances** nested 3-4 levels deep (e.g. the search icon's vector stroke) — out of scope to rebind locally, same precedent as every other remote-component finding in this audit.

## Changelog

- **Full token audit (2026-08-19):** fixed foreign color tokens on the root composition (`Text/Secondary` → `text + icon/secondary` on the workspace name label copied into this frame, `Text/Light`/`Grays/35` → `text + icon/tertiary` on the "·" separator and "Soon" tag text, `Base/Medium` foreign text style → `Body/Small-medium` on the same three text layers) — same "Twenty library" contamination pattern found throughout the System Component audit.
- Bound 15+ previously-unbound `itemSpacing`/padding values across both `Type=Regular` and `Type=Small` variants (root gap 32px → `spacing/8`, section gaps 8-12px → `spacing/2`/`spacing/3`, etc.), and the "Soon" chip's oversized corner radius (`50`, a forced-pill hack) → `border-radii/rounded-infinite`, matching the same pattern seen in Avatar/Button/Radio button's circular elements.
- All 7 Navigation-specific sub-atoms this pattern depends on were audited, fixed, and documented for the first time in the same pass — see the Composition section above for links. This closes the gap flagged in the previous draft of this doc ("these sub-atoms don't have their own component doc yet").
- Verified visually before/after on both `Type=Regular` and `Type=Small` — screenshots are pixel-identical to the pre-fix baseline, confirming all binding changes were value-preserving.
- Initial draft (2026-08-19) — written as a demonstration of the pattern-doc format, before the full audit above was agreed and completed.
